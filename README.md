**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹

As an Ai Engineer who has developed several end-to-end projects using TensorFlow, Keras, and General AI with NLP. These projects have been deployed on AWS using Docker. My portfolio includes a Text Sentiment Analysis tool capable of predicting emotions, mental health states, sarcasm, and overall sentiment. Additionally, Iâ€™ve developed a chatbot that leverages APIs to fetch and compare electronic product prices. One of my standout projects is a â€˜Chat with PDFâ€™ tool, which includes additional functionalities like Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech conversion.
